/*Write a program that reads three coordinates (x 1 , y 1 ), (x 2 , y 2 ) & (x 3 , y 3 ) as input and checks whether these numbers can be considered as the three vertices of a triangle. If the vertices can form a triangle then find the type (isosceles, equilateral or right-angled) of the triangle and the area of the triangle.*/
